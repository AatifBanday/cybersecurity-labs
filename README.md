# Cybersecurity Labs

This repository tracks my hands-on cybersecurity learning.

I will be documenting:
- TryHackMe write-ups
- Networking and Linux fundamentals
- Security+ study notes
- SIEM and log analysis labs
- Python/Bash automation scripts
- Incident-style report exercises

Goal:

Build the practical skills required for an entry-level cybersecurity role (SOC Analyst / Junior Security Analyst) and work toward roles under NOC TEER 1/2 for PR eligibility.

Progress updated weekly.
